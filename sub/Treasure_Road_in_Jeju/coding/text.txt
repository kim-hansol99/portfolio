Mazeland
It is the world's longest maze park, built under the theme of 
Jeju Island's threefold nature.
Arborvitae trees are planted in the wind maze, and cypress camellias and Rallandi, which bloom 
red in winter, are planted in 
the women's maze.
The stone maze has a mysterious atmosphere that will not be awkward even if a random wizard pops out.

Aaliyah
If you go to Jeju Island, Udo is a must.
The water was so clear 
and the sand was so clean!
If you have experience driving a scooter, we recommend renting a scooter.
I remember riding it for a long time :)

Jack
Dreamy weather and fresh air.
